# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bugs
This repository demonstrates two uncommon bugs that can occur when using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Using nonexistent or misspelled classes:** This can happen if you make a typo in a class name or use a class that was removed in a newer version of Tailwind.
2. **Using an outdated Tailwind version:** This can lead to compatibility issues and unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains code that demonstrates both of these errors. The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run the code (this will likely result in an error).
